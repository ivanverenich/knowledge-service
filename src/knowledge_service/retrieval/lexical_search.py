"""Find the Chunks whose words match a query that one reader may see.

Every Chunk stores two sets of search terms, each from the Document's title
(weight A), the headings it sits under (B), and its text (C):

- `chunks.search_en`, built with PostgreSQL's `english` configuration: word
  stems without stop words, so "requesting leave" matches "requests for
  leave". `search_english_chunks` reads it.
- `chunks.search_simple`, built with the `simple` configuration: every word
  lowercased, with no stemming and no stop words. `search_ukrainian_chunks`
  reads it. This is only a baseline for Ukrainian: "відпустка" matches
  "Відпустка" but not "відпустку" or "відпустки", an apostrophe splits
  "сім'я" into "сім" and "я", and a common word such as "на" matches almost
  every Chunk.

The query goes through the same configuration as the terms it searches.

What a caller can rely on:

- **Syntax.** The query is web-search text, read by `websearch_to_tsquery`:
  words must all match, `"quoted words"` must appear next to each other in
  that order, `or` between words accepts either, and `-word` excludes a word.
  Any other punctuation is ignored, so no text a user types can raise a
  syntax error. A query of only stop words or punctuation matches nothing.
  PostgreSQL still refuses a few queries with too many operators in a row,
  such as a line of 33 dashes; that raises `InvalidLexicalQuery`, and the
  caller's transaction stays usable.
- **Order.** Highest `ts_rank` first, so a match in a title outranks the same
  match in a heading, and a heading outranks the text; then by Chunk ID, so
  equal scores always come back in the same order.
- **Eligibility.** The same permission check as vector search sits in the
  same WHERE, so a Chunk the reader may not see is never ranked and never
  leaves the database.
- **Bounded.** At most `limit` matches, an int from 1 to `MAX_CANDIDATES`.
  Anything else, or a query that is not usable text, raises
  `InvalidLexicalQuery` before the database is used.
